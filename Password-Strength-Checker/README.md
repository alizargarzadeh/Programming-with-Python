# Password-Strength-Checker
This Python code serves as a password strength checker. It begins by prompting the user to enter a password and then performs a series of checks to assess the password's strength. If the password is less than 8 characters long, it informs the user that it must be at least 8 characters in length. If the password meets the length requirement, the code checks whether it contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. Depending on the results of these checks, the code provides the user with one of the following messages:

1. "Your password must be at least 8 characters" (if the password is too short).
2. "Your password does not contain an uppercase letter" (if no uppercase letters are found).
3. "Your password does not contain a lowercase letter" (if no lowercase letters are found).
4. "Your password does not contain a number" (if no numbers are found).
5. "Your password is strong" (if all the criteria are met).
This code helps users evaluate and improve the security of their passwords, making it a practical tool for enhancing password strength.
