# File Organizer and Media Classifier
This code is a file organizer and media classifier utility that automates the task of categorizing image and video files into directories based on their file types (extensions) and the year of their last modification date. It uses command-line arguments to specify source and destination directories. The script iterates through the source directory, identifies image and video files, and moves them to appropriate subdirectories within the destination folder, following a structured hierarchy. This tool enhances file management and organization by facilitating the sorting and arrangement of multimedia files for better access and archival purposes.
